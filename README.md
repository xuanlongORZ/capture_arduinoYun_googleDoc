# capture_arduinoYun_googleDoc
This is a demo of Arduino Yun. It aims to mesure the distance in using ultrason capture and upload the data to google doc in using Arduino Yun.   
It needs you to search the solution brought by official website of Temboo to create a google developper account and connect your equipment to google spreadsheet.   

What can you improve:   
1. You can also show the data on LCD block. Here I didn't put the head file of LCD.   
2. You can show your data on the webpage too, you can find the solution on Temboo website.
